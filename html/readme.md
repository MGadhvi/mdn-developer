# HTML
- HTML tags are not case sensitive 
- Elements can be block elements or inline elements
- Block elements appear on new line following the content that comes before it. Any content that comes after a block element also appears on a new line
- empty tags are often used to embed content in a file. The don't require a "/" at the end but doing so makes the file valid XML
- Boolean attributes can only have one value. They are often the same as the name of the attribute
- Single or double quotes can be used for attributes but can't be mixed
